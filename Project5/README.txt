Project 5

Name:
Ethan Clifford
Time to Complete:
~6 hours
Feedback:

This was a good difficulty, or maybe a bit easy.  It was
	 straightforward enough to pass most of the tests, but a few stumped me 
	 for a little bit, especially the hidden shrink test as I struggled to 
	 figure out how to test the circular nature of the queue.

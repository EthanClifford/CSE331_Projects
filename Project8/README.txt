Project 8
Name:
Ethan Clifford
Time to Complete:
~6 hours
Feedback:

  This project was very straightforward, however I struggeld a lot on
the heap_sort method.  Creating the max heap wasn't super tricky, my main issue
was in actually ordering the list.
Sources Used:  I used Dr. Onsay's code in her lectures 16 and 17 and I used mimir
for the docstrings.

Project 4


Name:
Ethan Clifford
Time to Complete:
~8 hours
Feedback:

This was a good difficulty, or maybe a bit easy.  It was
	 straightforward enough to pass most of the tests, but a few stumped me 
	 for a little bit.
Sources Used:
I used Dr. Onsay's stack code from Lecture 8 
	     as a template for most of the simpler methods

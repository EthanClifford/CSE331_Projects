Project 6
Name:
Ethan Clifford
Time to Complete:
~10 hours
Feedback:

  This was a good difficulty, however I really struggeled with 
the traversals even though I undrstood them conceptually.  However, besides 
that, the remove method was the only really hard part.
Sources Used:  I used Piazza, the help hours, and Dr. Onsay's binary_tree 
code from Lectures 11-13 as a basis for my inorder traversal, and from there 
the other two traversals, and Mimir for the function description part of the
docstrings.

Project 9
Name:
Ethan Clifford
Time to Complete:
~16 hours
Feedback:

  This project was rather difficult mainly because of construct_graph.
That function was probably the hardest in this project and it was something that
I feel wasn't gone over in class as much as some of the other topics addressed
in this project.
Sources Used:  I used Mimir for the docstrings.
